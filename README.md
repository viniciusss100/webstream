# WebStreamrMBG

> **WebStreamrMBG** is a fork of [WebStreamr](https://github.com/webstreamr/webstreamr) with custom patches and hosted on Hugging Face Spaces.

[Stremio](https://www.stremio.com/) add-on which provides HTTP URLs from streaming websites.

HTTP streams have limitations.
For a better experience, I'd advise using a Debrid service and WebStreamrMBG as fallback.
[TorBox](https://torbox.app/subscription?referral=f22eb00d-27ce-4e20-85fc-68da3d018b99) is working very well.

## Public Instances

| Instance | URL |

## Known issues / limitations

- PixelServer / pixeldrain has a daily limit of 6 GB per IP: https://pixeldrain.dev
- Dropload and SuperVideo on Android do not work because Stremio does not use the `Referer` header properly via HLS playlists: https://github.com/Stremio/stremio-bugs/issues/2389, maybe https://github.com/Stremio/stremio-bugs/issues/1579
- MediaFlow proxy has to be used in an inefficient way because Stremio on Android or its players cannot deal with HLS playlist with redirects: https://github.com/Stremio/stremio-bugs/issues/1574
- FlareSolverr cookies cannot be used because Cloudflare does techniques like TLS fingerprinting most likely. But FlareSolverr uses a session per host and should be quick.
- VidSrc works but rate limits heavily and is therefore only queried as fallback if nothing else is found.
- RgShows detects shared usage and blocks IPs. It therefore only works on private instances.

## MediaFlow Proxy

[MediaFlow Proxy](https://github.com/mhdzumair/mediaflow-proxy/) can be added when configuring the add-on to gain access to a couple of more file hosters.
It depends highly on the language / source used if that unlocks more streams or not.

MediaFlow proxy is needed because some hosters ip-lock streams and the add-on does not run on the same device that will stream the video.

The following hosters can be used only with MediaFlow Proxy:

- Fastream
- FileLions
- FileMoon
- LuluStream
- Mixdrop
- Streamtape
- VOE

## Self-Hosting

You can run the latest WebStreamrMBG via Docker. E.g.

```shell
docker run \
    --detach=true \
    --name webstreamr-mbg \
    --rm \
    --pull always \
    --publish 51546:51546 \
    --env TMDB_ACCESS_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN" \
    --volume /tmp:/tmp \
    newman2x/webstreamr-mbg
```
